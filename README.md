  - [The challenge](#product preview component)

- [My process](#I used this opportunity to work on my current HTML & CSS knowledge to start the project myself before searching for inspiration on techniques and good work practices which led me to a tutorial by Kevin Powell on YouTube. This enabled me to tune in to aspects i hadn't thought of and especially building on having a ::root in my CSS to define important factors like colours, fonts and repeated actions to increase workflow.

- Furthermore improving on my approach when looking at a design and thinking clearly what i need to do to make everything flow efficiently. I found Josh Comeauâ€™s CSS reset to be incredibly enlighting on what i can do to build my own templates in CSS to improve consistency in style.

- With this specific task i found that a Display of grid was most efficient as i started on a responive mobile layout. This then allowed me to target my product page at min-width:600px and bring in grid-template-column which made the image and product content side by side with only minor changes made after for desktop.

- In general a great task to build a efficient workflow.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>A great task to complete</h1>
```

```css roots
:root {
  --clr-primary-500: hsl(158, 36%, 20%);
  --clr-primary-400: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  --clr-secondary-200: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);

  --clr-neutral-900: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
  --clr-neutral-400: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
  --clr-neutral-100: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

  --ff-accent: "Fraunces", serif;
  --ff-base: "Montserrat", sans-serif;

  --fw-regular: 500;
  --fw-bold: 700;
}
```
